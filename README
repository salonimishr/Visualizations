# Visualizations

### In this time, as data is getting bigger and bigger, to get the insights of the data, visualization is first strategy to understand it. 
### I made two different projects for visualizations. 

### Tableaue Project
In first project, I used Tableaue and its tools to get insight of accident related data. This has values from February 2016 to January 2020 from 49 states. 
This dataset has 3 million records and 49 variables. It is in csv format. Variables has geospatial vaiables alongwith weather data. There were 9 boolean variables stating if 
this condition was there or not, I pivoted these variables into one and used bar graph along with line graph to explore the data better. Firstly, I used map to represent the cities 
with highest accidents and to understand how each city is doing in four years frame, I connected each city with line chart. I used inverted pyramid bar chart to understand the
accident frequency and attached each state with CDC webpage, where we can see how accidents are one of the leading causes of death in 2017. For the description variable, I
used word cloud to see which highways are associated with the accidents. For zipcodes, I used bar graph and used filters to get the information from which states, 
the zipcodes belong. Tableaue's forecast option was used to forecast next year accidents with confidence bands. Different graphs were used and I interconnected them to get
better insights. I also used extensions in this project. I had below conclusions from the above visualizations:
* After looking at the visualization report strong association found between number of accidents and weather condition, traffic signals, interstate highways.
* Some states are found more prone to the accidents.
* Strong association is also observed between number of accidents  and month of years as well as time of the day.
* It is concluded that most of the accidents happen:in the month of October, in the day-time, in the clear weather and in the 60 to 80F temperature.

### Python Project
I merged different datasets for this project, I downloaded from WHO website. In this dataset, there are 202 rows representing different countries. The data is of 
the year 2017. Certain factors, like your sex, age, or income can influence your health, your risk for certain diseases, and your risk for being seriously affected by
public health emergencies. The same is true for populations.1 Knowing a population’s characteristics, including their vulnerabilities and resources, can help public health 
professionals determine possible effects of health problems or environmental conditions on disease trends and patterns over time and across locations.

To solve this purpose visualizations tools and cluster analysis are used.
Visualization tools: Animation, interactive visualizations, map, Sunburst, and other plots.
For clustering, I used K-Means analysis with silhouette analysis.

I used Folium, Matplotlib, Bokeh, Seaborn and Plotly libraries. I used plotly and folium for population density and median age of each age respectively. From plotly, I made
sunburst which was interactive and  where each ray represent country to explore health life expectancy. I used grid chart for Maternal, perinatal and newborn health variables.
Bubble graph, marginal scatter plot were used for different variables. To understand how poverty, population, literacy and health are interrelated to each other, so I explored
it further by taking physician density vs adult mortality rate and how government expenditure on health across all countries in different continents affect each other. 
I used animation for this. I found that as physician density increases adult mortality decreases moreover government health expenditure also reduces the adult mortality rate.
Silhouette analysis can be used to study the separation distance between the resulting clusters. , I used “per capita government expenditure on health (PPP int. $)” vs “Adult
mortality rate (probability of dying between 15 to 60 years per 1000 population” to find clustering. I found 4 clusters by silhouette analysis and took 4 clusters for further 
analysis. By K-Means clustering, clustering of countries in between 4 clusters were given. Cluster 1 with very low government expenditure on health whereas cluster 4 has the
highest. In cluster 1, most countries of Asia, Africa and South America is there. In cluster 2, there are many developed countries of North America, Australia and Europe but
in cluster 3, Argentina, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia are there. In cluster4, it is only Norway and its islands.
